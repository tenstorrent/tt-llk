# Mailboxes

There are 16 mailboxes within each Tensix tile, one _from_ each of RISCV (B, T0, T1, T2) _to_ each of RISCV (B, T0, T1, T2). Note that there are no mailboxes to or from RISCV NC. Notwithstanding RISCV NC, each RISCV can read from the four mailboxes which go to it, and write to the four mailboxes which go from it. Mailboxes cannot be accessed by the NoC or by the Tensix coprocessor; they are exclusively for the RISCV cores.

Each mailbox is a FIFO queue of 32-bit values. Writes will push a value onto the queue, whereas reads will either pop a value or query whether any values are present. It is not possible to pop from an empty FIFO; a read attempting to do so will not generate a read-response until the FIFO is subsequently written to. For the purposes of memory ordering, the read and write sides of each mailbox count as separate memory regions, even though their memory addresses are identical.

Each mailbox can hold up to four 32-bit values. Furthermore, considering all four mailboxes that any given RISCV can write to, those four mailboxes in aggregate can only hold four 32-bit values (for example, one value in each mailbox, or four values in one mailbox and the other three empty). Attempting to push more values than this will cause the writes to sit in shared buffers within the memory subsystem. If those shared buffers become full, the issuing RISCV will be stalled until space becomes available.

See also [PCBufs](PCBufs.md) for separate FIFO queues from RISCV B to each of RISCV (T0, T1, T2).

## Memory map

The mailbox referenced by a particular address depends on three things: the address, the issuing RISCV, and whether the access is a read or a write.

<table><thead><tr><th>Name and address range</th><th>RISCV&nbsp;B</th><th>RISCV&nbsp;T0</th><th>RISCV&nbsp;T1</th><th>RISCV&nbsp;T2</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td><code>TENSIX_MAILBOX0_BASE</code><br/><code>0xFFEC_0000</code> to <code>0xFFEC_0FFF</code></td><td>B to B</td><td>Write: T0 to B<br/>Read: B to T0</td><td>Write: T1 to B<br/>Read: B to T1</td><td>Write: T2 to B<br/>Read: B to T2</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>TENSIX_MAILBOX2_BASE</code><br/><code>0xFFEC_2000</code> to <code>0xFFEC_2FFF</code></td><td>Write: B to T1<br/>Read: T1 to B</td><td>Write: T0 to T1<br/>Read: T1 to T0</td><td>T1 to T1</td><td>Write: T2 to T1<br/>Read: T1 to T2</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TENSIX_MAILBOX3_BASE</code><br/><code>0xFFEC_3000</code> to <code>0xFFEC_3FFF</code></td><td>Write: B to T2<br/>Read: T2 to B</td><td>Write: T0 to T2<br/>Read: T2 to T0</td><td>Write: T1 to T2<br/>Read: T2 to T1</td><td>T2 to T2</td></tr>
</table>

Once the particular mailbox has been determined, the functional model for writes is:
```python
while mailbox.full or sum(mb.size for mb in issuing_core_writable_mailboxes) >= 4:
  wait
mailbox.push(value)
```

For reads, two operations are possible: non-blocking query whether the mailbox has anything available to read, and blocking pop. The functional model is:
```python
if address & 4:
  return 0 if mailbox.empty else 1
else:
  while mailbox.empty:
    wait
  return mailbox.pop()
```

Although any address within the address range can be used, it is conventional to always use `TENSIX_MAILBOX{i}_BASE` for writes, and either `TENSIX_MAILBOX{i}_BASE + 0` or `TENSIX_MAILBOX{i}_BASE + 4` for reads.

Note that the `wait`s in the above happen within the memory subsystem; they prevent the memory region in question from processing the next request, but they do not _necessarily_ prevent the issuing RISCV from executing some more RISCV instructions.

## Memory ordering

When writing to a mailbox, it is usually the case that the programmer wants the mailbox write-request to be processed _after_ all earlier write-requests have been processed. When reading from a mailbox, it is usually the case that the programmer wants the mailbox read-response to be obtained _before_ any later read-requests are emitted. Neither of these things happen by default; see [memory ordering](MemoryOrdering.md) for details on how to avoid race conditions and ensure that they do happen.
