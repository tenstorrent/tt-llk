# `SFPSTOCHRND` (Vectorised reduce floating-point precision)

**Summary:** Operating lanewise, reduces mantissa precision of an FP32 value down from 23 bits to either 7 bits or 10 bits. The discarded mantissa bits are used for rounding, which can be either stochastic or round to nearest with ties away from zero. Various extreme floating-point values are also normalised away:
* Denormals become positive zero.
* Negative zero becomes positive zero.
* -NaN becomes negative infinity.
* +NaN becomes positive infinity.

This flavour of `SFPSTOCHRND` is intended to be used prior to an [`SFPSTORE`](SFPSTORE.md) instruction:
* `SFPSTORE` with `MOD0_FMT_BF16`: If the mantissa precision is reduced to 7 bits, a store with `MOD0_FMT_BF16` will be exact.
* `SFPSTORE` with `MOD0_FMT_FP16`: If the mantissa precision is reduced to either 7 or 10 bits, a store with `MOD0_FMT_FP16` will suffer no loss of mantissa precision (though there will be loss of exponent range, with out of range values clamped to positive or negative infinity).
* `SFPSTORE` with `MOD0_FMT_FP32`: If the mantissa precision is reduced to either 7 or 10 bits, a store with `MOD0_FMT_FP32` will be exact, and any subsequent conversion to TF32 will also be exact.

Due to a hardware bug, stochastic rounding has a slight bias towards increasing the magnitude rather than being 50:50, and can even sometimes increase the magnitude of values which do not require rounding.

**Backend execution unit:** [Vector Unit (SFPU)](VectorUnit.md), round sub-unit
