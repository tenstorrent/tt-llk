# Running Tests

All test runs MUST be delegated to the `/llk-test-runner` subagent. Do not run tests directly.

Reuse the same `/llk-test-runner` subagent for repeated test runs after a failure (up to 10 reuses). If you need a fresh context or the reuse limit is reached, start a new `/llk-test-runner` subagent.
