# Running Tests

All test runs MUST be delegated to the `/llk-test-runner` subagent. Do not run tests directly.

If multiple test files can be run together (same scenario and args), prefer a single command that targets multiple files in one run (e.g., a `TEST_PATH` that lists multiple paths or `PYTEST_ARGS` that selects multiple files). Only split into multiple commands when you need different scenarios, flags, or isolation.

Perf tests must run alone; do not combine perf tests with other tests in the same command.

Reuse the same `/llk-test-runner` subagent for repeated test runs after a failure (up to 10 reuses). If you need a fresh context or the reuse limit is reached, start a new `/llk-test-runner` subagent.
