description: Use for Tensix architecture or instruction details
---

## Documentation search guide

Use this rule only for architecture or instruction details.

### When to use the primary source
1. You need details about how a specific instruction works.
2. You need architecture-specific information about Tensix or related units.

### Primary source
Use the DeepWiki MCP for `tenstorrent/tt-isa-documentation`. You can either:
- Pull a specific file for a detailed description.
- Ask focused questions, for example:
  - "How does [INSTRUCTION] work? What does each bit represent?"
  - "How does [TENSIX COMPONENT] handle [SITUATION]?"
  - "Find all related files for [USE CASE]."


### When to use the secondary source
- The question is about LLK parameters or actions.
- You need to explain behavior using code references.

### Secondary source
- Use GREP to find related files; filter by architecture.
- ONLY search folders under `tt_llk_[ARCHITECTURE]` and `tests`.
- If the architecture is not provided, include all; otherwise, do not read unrelated architectures.

#### How to handle files
- For each file you read, identify the code path that implements the requested information.
- Divide analysis into parts: Unpack, Math, Pack.
- Explain how those parts relate to each other (Only if they relate).

### Fallback source
<IMPORTANT>Use this section only when all other options fail to find the answer.</IMPORTANT>
If everything else does not answer the question, check TT-METAL documentation:
