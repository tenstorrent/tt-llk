## Overview ##

This repository contains header-only low-level kernels for Tenstorrent AI chips, including Grayskull (deprecated), Wormhole, and Blackhole.

These kernels serve as foundational compute primitives, acting as building blocks for higher-level software stacks that implement machine learning (ML) operations.

Additionally, the repository includes a test environment designed to validate LLK APIs.
