# tt-llk: CPP Low Level Kernels (LLK) & test infrastructure #

## Overview ##

This repository contains header-only low level kernels for Tenstorrent AI chips (Grayskull (deprecated), Wormhole_B0, and Blackhole), which represent foundational primitives of compute used as building blocks for higher level software stacks that implement ML OPs. Alongside the kernels is a test environment used for validating LLK APIs.

## Install ##

1. Clone repository
2. Set up test environment per testing [README](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-llk/blob/main/tests/README.md)
